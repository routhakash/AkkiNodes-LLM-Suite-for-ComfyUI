a time traveler trying to fix a mistake
a grizzled detective with a troubled past
a young, naive mage testing their powers
a curious android discovering human emotion
a hardened space marine on their last mission
a cynical mercenary with a hidden heart of gold
a reformed thief trying to go straight
a wise-cracking rogue with a gambling debt
a ghost with unfinished business
an elderly gardener who knows ancient secrets
a starship captain exploring the unknown
a bio-engineer who has created something dangerous
a librarian of a forbidden, magical archive
an overworked office drone who stumbles into a fantasy world
a struggling artist who can paint things into reality
