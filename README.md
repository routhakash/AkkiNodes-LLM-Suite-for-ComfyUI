## ‚ú® Core Philosophy: 100% Local, 100% Private

> ### üåê No Internet? No Problem.
> This entire suite is built around one core principle: **your creativity should never depend on a cloud service.** All Large Language Model (LLM) processing happens directly on your own computer. This means:
> - ‚úÖ **Total Privacy:** Your scripts, stories, and ideas stay on your machine.
> - ‚úÖ **No API Keys, No Fees:** Run as many generations as you want, for free.
> - ‚úÖ **Offline Capable:** Once set up, you can generate content without an internet connection.
> - ‚úÖ **Uncensored Creativity:** You have full control over the models you use and the content you create.

## üìñ Node Reference (Core Production Suite v77.0.0)

### <div style="background-color: #2a3d4a; padding: 5px; border-radius: 5px;">Phase 1: Narrative Development</div>
*Goal: To transform a simple idea into a complete, well-structured, and machine-readable screenplay.*

#### `AI Story Writer (v5.2)`
The starting point of the entire pipeline. Takes a simple concept and creative parameters to generate a complete prose story.
*   **Architecture:** Uses an **"Orthogonal Input & Ground Truth Mandate"** to ensure factual consistency and prevent logical contradictions in the narrative.

#### `AI ScriptCrafter P1, P2, P3`
An automated "Writer's Room" that adapts the prose story into a professional screenplay.
*   **P1 (Bible) (v7.2):** Creates the canonical **Character Bible** and **World Bible**. Its **"Analyze & Refine"** architecture uses a deterministic Python process to guarantee data accuracy.
*   **P2 (Beat Sheet) (v4.0):** Creates a 15-point structural blueprint for the story.
*   **P3 (Screenplay) (v16.8):** Writes a creatively rich screenplay, then uses a **"Creative Draft + Hybrid Heuristic Parser"** to guarantee perfect, industry-standard formatting.

### <div style="background-color: #3d4a2a; padding: 5px; border-radius: 5px;">Phase 2: Pre-Production & Data Consolidation</div>
*Goal: To translate the screenplay into a single, canonical spreadsheet (CSV) that governs the visual production.*

#### `AI Cinematographer (Pro) (v3.9)`
Acts as the Director of Photography, reading the screenplay and creating a detailed, shot-by-shot breakdown.
*   **Architecture:** Its **"Hybrid AI + Deterministic Resolver"** pattern fixes common AI weaknesses (like pronoun ambiguity) at the source.

#### `AI QC Supervisor (v2.1)`
A data sanitization filter that cleans the raw output from the `Cinematographer`, removing "junk" data to prevent corruption of the production database.

#### `Pro Shot List Parser (v9.4)`
The definitive gatekeeper of clean data. Ingests the clean shot breakdown and produces the final, canonical **production CSV file**.
*   **Architecture:** Employs a **"Context-Aware Two-Pass Transform"** to perform high-fidelity data normalization, preventing data loss and dialogue corruption.

### <div style="background-color: #4a2a4a; padding: 5px; border-radius: 5px;">Phase 3: Visual Development (Lookdev)</div>
*Goal: To establish the final, approved "art direction" for every character and set.*

#### `Asset Selector (v3.6)`
The Production Manager. Reads the final CSV and provides master lists of all assets, allowing the user to select a specific character or set for look development.

#### `AI Character Lookdev (v13.0)` & `AI Set Lookdev (v6.0)`
The Art Department. These nodes generate rich, detailed, story-specific prompts for creating character model sheets and set designs.
*   **Architecture:** Use a **"Hybrid Multi-Stage AI + Python Enforcer"** pattern to guarantee factual details (like a character's age) are 100% correct in the final creative prompt.

### <div style="background-color: #4a3d2a; padding: 5px; border-radius: 5px;">Phase 4: Shot Production (Final Prompting)</div>
*Goal: To combine the art direction from Phase 3 with the action of a single shot to create a final, ready-to-render image prompt.*

#### `Shot Selector (v3.6)` & `Shot Asset Loader (v3.7)`
Utilities for isolating a single shot and fetching all of its required data and lookdev assets (images and prompts) from the canonical files produced in previous phases.

#### `AI Scene Choreographer (Bible) (v4.3)`
The creative engine for this phase. It performs a scene-wide creative pass, ingesting the CSV data and all relevant lookdev prompts to generate bible-aware, lookdev-consistent prompts for all shots in a scene.

### <div style="background-color: #444; padding: 5px; border-radius: 5px;">Utilities</div>

#### `LLM Loader` & `LLM Loader (LM Studio)`
The core nodes for loading your local GGUF language models or connecting to an LM Studio server.

#### `File I/O Nodes`
A comprehensive suite of utilities for project management, allowing for robust saving and loading of any text data (stories, bibles, CSVs, prompts, etc.) to keep your project organized.
