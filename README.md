The world of Generative AI is often a chaotic collection of powerful but disconnected tools. My work is dedicated to solving this problem. As a GenAI Creative Engineer, I specialize in architecting robust, autonomous **AI Agents** and integrating them into seamless, production-ready workflows. This project, the AkkiNodes Suite for ComfyUI, is a practical demonstration of this philosophy, designed to provide a fully automated "Script to Screen" pipeline that runs entirely on your local machine.

## ‚ú® My Engineering Philosophy

My approach to building with Generative AI is guided by a core set of engineering principles, designed to create robust, reliable, and truly automated systems.

**1. The "Specialist Model": A Crew of AI Agents**
I design workflows that operate like a professional production team. Instead of relying on a single, monolithic AI, this suite is powered by a crew of highly specialized **AI Agents**. Each agent (the *ScriptCrafter*, the *Cinematographer*, the *Lookdev Artist*) is an expert in its domain, leading to higher quality, more consistent, and more controllable creative outputs.

**2. Code is Law: Deterministic Systems over Non-Deterministic AI**
For tasks that require absolute precision and reliability‚Äîlike data parsing, formatting, or enforcing factual continuity‚ÄîAI is the wrong tool. My workflows use AI for what it does best (creativity) and rely on robust, deterministic Python code for what AI does poorly (correctness). This "Python Enforcer" pattern is the key to a stable pipeline.

**3. Fix Data at the Source: Proactive Quality Control**
A stable workflow cannot be built on a foundation of "garbage-in, garbage-out." My philosophy is to fix data errors and creative deficiencies in the node that produces them (the "producer"), rather than creating "patch" nodes downstream. This keeps the pipeline lean, efficient, and easy to debug.

**4. 100% Local, 100% Private (The Foundation)**
And finally, your creative process should be yours alone. This entire suite of tools and agents is built to run entirely on your local machine, guaranteeing total privacy, zero API fees, and complete creative control over your work.

**5. The Assembly Line: End-to-End Automation**
The ultimate goal of a robust workflow is to minimize manual friction. This suite is architected as an automated production line where you provide the high-level creative inputs‚Äîthe 'building blocks' of your story‚Äîat the beginning. From there, the chain of AI Agents and deterministic tools handles the entire production process, automatically generating the narrative documents, production data, and final visual prompts without requiring manual file editing or data correction between stages.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation Guide

1.  **Clone or Download:**
    *   Clone this repository into your `ComfyUI/custom_nodes/` directory.
    *   Alternatively, download the ZIP, extract it, and place the `AkkiNodes-LLM-Suite-for-ComfyUI` folder inside `ComfyUI/custom_nodes/`.

2.  **Install Dependencies (Windows):**
    *   Navigate into the new `AkkiNodes-LLM-Suite-for-ComfyUI` folder.
    *   **Right-click `install.bat` and select "Run as administrator"**. This only needs to be done once.

3.  **Download a GGUF Model:**
    *   This suite requires a GGUF-format Large Language Model. You can find thousands of compatible models on [Hugging Face's GGUF Model Hub](https://huggingface.co/models?search=gguf).
    *   Place your downloaded `.gguf` file into your `ComfyUI/models/llms/` directory.

4.  **Restart ComfyUI:**
    *   Completely close and restart your ComfyUI instance.

## üñ•Ô∏è System & Environment

This suite is designed for local execution and is GPU-intensive, particularly during LLM and image generation phases. The primary development and testing environment is as follows:

*   **OS:** Windows 11 Pro
*   **CPU:** 13th Gen Intel Core i7-13700K
*   **GPU:** NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060
*   **VRAM:** 12 GB
*   **System RAM:** 64 GB
*   **ComfyUI Version:** v0.3.50
*   **Python Version:** v3.12.0

While the suite may work on other configurations, performance will vary. A GPU with at least **12GB of VRAM** is strongly recommended for a smooth experience when loading larger GGUF models.
