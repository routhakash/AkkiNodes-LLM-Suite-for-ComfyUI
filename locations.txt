a bustling cyberpunk megalopolis drenched in neon and rain
a forgotten underwater city of glass and coral
a generation starship lost in the interstellar void
a magical, ever-shifting library
a quiet, isolated cabin in a snow-covered forest
a war-torn battlefield in the moments after a ceasefire
a grand, opulent masquerade ball in a Venetian palace
the windswept, grassy plains of a fantasy kingdom
a derelict, haunted space station in a decaying orbit
a secret underground resistance base
the caldera of a dormant supervolcano
a petrified forest under a sky with two moons
a desert marketplace bustling with alien merchants
a suburban neighborhood where everything is unnervingly perfect
the crystal caves deep within the Underdark
