static wide shot, captured from a slightly low angle using an ARRI Alexa Mini with a 35mm Prime lens, establishes the Silverwood Marketplace in its entirety. The camera focuses on a bustling scene of commerce and activity among elves, showcasing the sprawling interior beneath a dense canopy overhead which creates a dappled effect on the stone floor below. The marketplace is structured around a colossal, naturally formed thick branch interwoven with intricately carved stone pillars reminiscent of stylized trees. Elves energetically barter and interact joyfully amidst overflowing baskets of produce, scattered coins, colorful fabrics, and intricate metalwork; their voices blend into a vibrant marketplace ambiance.\n\nThe elves are slender women with high cheekbones, large jade-green eyes that shift with the light, and pale ivory skin dotted with faint freckles across their shoulders. Their long, flowing forest green hair has emerald highlights in the light. They wear loose-fitting tunics crafted from woven bark fibers dyed a muted olive green, simple leather cords, hooded shawls fashioned from woven leaves and vines adorned with iridescent beetle wings, braided leather belts worn low on their hips, small pouches made of cured leaves, dark brown fingerless deerskin gloves, and intricately carved wooden pendants shaped like stylized leaves. One elf holds a small carving knife sheathed at her hip, its handle wrapped in leather cord; the pendant faintly glows with runes. The movement of their robes is subtle as they gesture during bartering, reflecting the diffused sunlight filtering through the canopy above.\n\nThe interior of the Silverwood Marketplace is bathed in soft, diffused light that filters through the dense canopy, creating long, subtle shadows and highlighting the rich greens and browns of the natural materials. The architecture blends seamlessly with the surrounding forest, utilizing damp bark and polished stone to create a harmonious and organic feel; fine motes of dust dance lazily within the sunbeams suspended in the still air carrying a faint scent of damp earth and aged textiles. The scene is rendered in photorealistic detail with global illumination enabled, emphasizing the textures of bark, stone, silk, and leaves to capture the ancient elven aesthetic, while a gentle warmth permeates the marketplace highlighting its intricate carvings and stylized trees.GENRE: Epic / High Fantasy\nPERIOD: The Age of Magic\nTONE: Mystical, Serene, Perilous\nAESTHETIC: Elven, Ancient,

The question is, will Trixie embrace her power or succumb to fear?\n3.  **Setup:** We are introduced to Trixie, a young witch with Feywild heritage living in Silverwood; she's hesitant but possesses innate magical ability and feels responsible for protecting the city; Gordon Hamilton’s arrival disrupts this established order.\n4.  **Catalyst (Inciting Incident):** Gordon Hamilton’s arrival in Silverwood and his inquiries about Trixie immediately threaten her world, signaling danger and setting the plot into motion.\n5.  **Debate:** Trixie initially dismisses the Lumiflora as a myth, protesting “He wouldn't,” demonstrating inner doubt and reluctance to accept the potential responsibility placed upon her.\n6.  **Break into Act 2:** When she confronts Hamilton in the library and he offers a choice (\"cooperate...resist\"), Trixie decides to play along, committing to the journey into the Forbidden Forest – crossing the threshold into a world of greater peril.\n7.  **B Story:** Elara's unwavering support and concern for Trixie represents the B story; their friendship provides emotional grounding and highlights themes of trust and loyalty as Trixie faces her destiny.\n8.  **Fun and Games:** The journey through the Forbidden Forest, with Hamilton clearing a path while Trixie subtly manipulates the environment, showcases the initial challenges and tests of skill required to reach the Lumiflora. This is the promise of adventure and magical confrontation.\n9.  **Midpoint:** When they near the Whisperwind Glade and Trixie feels the Lumiflora's presence – a surge of power she must now contend with - significantly raises the stakes, shifting from a quest for information to a direct confrontation with destiny. \n10. **Bad Guys Close In:** Hamilton’s growing frustration and determination as he nears the Glade, coupled with his attempts to use an artifact to harness its power, intensifies the pressure on Trixie.\n11. **All Is Lost:** Hamilton breaks free from Trixie's vines and raises his enchanted sword, seemingly ready to overpower her – representing a moment of near-defeat for the protagonist. \n12. **Dark Night of the Soul:** As she channels her own energy into the Glade, Trixie realizes that power isn't about control but about nurturing and protection—a critical understanding born from facing imminent danger.\n13. **Break into Act 3:** Trixie declares, “The Lumiflora chooses its guardian,” fully embracing her role as protector and confronting Hamilton directly – signifying a shift to proactive action.\n14. **Finale:** Trixie uses the Glade’s magic to banish Hamilton, protecting Silverwood and demonstrating mastery over her newfound power—resolving the conflict by rejecting control and embracing guardianship.\n15. **Final Image:** Trixie gently touches the Lumiflora petals, a contemplative expression on her face as she gazes at the shimmering canopy – mirroring the opening image but now showing her transformed into a confident Guardian of the Lumiflora, ready to embrace her destiny."],"color":"#2a363b","bgcolor":"#3f5159"},{"id":2760,"type":"ShowText|pysssss","pos":[1890,230],"size":[400,160],"flags":{},"order":196,"mode":4,"inputs":[{"localized_name":"text","name":"text","type":"STRING","link":50533}],"outputs":[{"localized_name":"STRING","name":"STRING","shape":6,"type":"STRING","links":[50534]}],"title":"character_bible","properties":{"cnr_id":"comfyui-custom-scripts","ver":"1.2.5","Node name for S&R":"ShowText|pysssss","ue_properties":{"version":"7.0.1","widget_ue_connectable":{}}},"widgets_values":["NAME: Trixie Stevens\nROLE: Protagonist\nAGE: Late Teenager (17-19 years old)\nGOAL: To protect the Lumiflora and prevent Gordon Hamilton from exploiting its power.\nMOTIVATION: A sense of responsibility to her Feywild heritage, a desire to safeguard Silverwood and the balance of magic, and a growing understanding of her own magical potential.\nFLAW: Initially hesitant and unsure of herself, prone to doubt despite her inherent power.\nARC: Transforms from a tentative young witch into a confident guardian, embracing her destiny and wielding the Lumiflora’s power responsibly.\nDESCRIPTION: A barely nineteen-year-old witch with an affinity for nature, often seen tracing arcane symbols on bark while wearing a shimmering moonpetal silk cloak.\n//---CHARACTER_BREAK---//\nNAME: Gordon Hamilton\nROLE: Antagonist\nAGE: Middle-aged (40s)\nGOAL: To acquire the Lumiflora and harness its power for his own, currently unknown, purposes.\nMOTIVATION: Driven by a belief in controlling powerful forces and eliminating perceived threats to humanity – likely fueled by past trauma or a misguided sense of duty.\nFLAW: Arrogant, inflexible, and blinded by his obsession with control, leading him to underestimate the power of nature and the resilience of those who protect it.\nARC: Remains static - a force of rigid opposition, ultimately defeated but potentially foreshadowing future threats.\nDESCRIPTION: A human monster hunter with cold, grey eyes and a raspy voice, carrying enchanted weaponry and an unsettling reputation.\n//---CHARACTER_BREAK---//\nNAME: Elara Meadowlight\nROLE: Supporting Character\nAGE: Unknown (likely young adult)\nGOAL: To protect Trixie and ensure the safety of Silverwood.\nMOTIVATION: Deep loyalty to her friend Trixie, a desire to uphold the peace and well-being of her elven community, and a belief in the inherent goodness of nature.\nFLAW: Overprotective of Trixie, sometimes hindering her growth by trying to shield her from danger;

Trixie Stevens, barely nineteen summers old, clung to a branch overlooking the bustling marketplace, her fingers tracing arcane symbols into the damp bark. Below, elves bartered for shimmering silks and enchanted trinkets, their laughter echoing through the leaves. But Trixie wasn’t interested in trade; she was searching. Searching for any sign of him - Gordon Hamilton.\n\nHe'd arrived three days ago, a storm cloud in Silverwood’s otherwise serene atmosphere. A human monster hunter, with eyes as cold and grey as a winter sky and a reputation that preceded him like the stench of brimstone. He was hunting something – or rather, *someone* – according to the hushed whispers that followed him through the city. Someone like her.\n\nTrixie was a witch, though she preferred the term 'weaver of magic.' Her lineage traced back to the ancient Feywild, granting her an affinity for nature and raw magical power far exceeding most elves in Silverwood. But such gifts attracted unwanted attention, especially from those who feared what they didn’t understand.\n\nA shadow fell across her branch. A tall, lithe elf with silver hair braided with forest flowers – Elara Meadowlight, Trixie's closest friend and a skilled healer. “Still watching him?” she asked softly, her voice laced with concern. \"He’s been asking about you.\"\n\nTrixie sighed. “I know. I feel his gaze like a physical weight.” She shifted nervously, pulling her cloak tighter around herself. The cloak was woven from moonpetal silk, shimmering with protective enchantments – meager defenses against someone as formidable as Hamilton.\n\n“The Council is worried,” Elara continued. \"They believe he's after the Lumiflora.\"\n\nTrixie’s eyes widened. The Lumiflora. A creature of myth and legend - a sentient flower said to possess the power to amplify magic tenfold, blooming only once every century in the heart of the Whisperwind Glade, deep within the Forbidden Forest.  Its existence was considered folklore by most elves; Trixie had always dismissed it as such too.\n\n\"He wouldn't,\" she protested, though a sliver of dread pierced her bravado. “The Lumiflora is just a story.”\n\nElara shook her head. \"Hamilton doesn’t believe in stories. He believes in power, and the Lumiflora holds immense power indeed.\" She paused, studying Trixie’s face. \"And your connection to the Feywild...he might see you as a key to finding it.\"\n\nThat night, Trixie dreamt of shimmering petals and ancient voices whispering through roots and vines. She awoke with an unsettling certainty: Hamilton *was* after the Lumiflora, and he believed she could lead him there. \n\nThe next morning, she found him – Gordon Hamilton – in the city’s oldest library, poring over dusty tomes filled with forgotten lore. He didn't acknowledge her presence until she spoke.\n\n“You seek the Lumiflora,” Trixie stated, her voice trembling slightly despite her efforts to remain calm.\n\nHe finally looked up, his grey eyes assessing her with a chilling intensity. “A perceptive young woman,” he said, his voice raspy and devoid of warmth. \"The legends speak of a Fey-touched witch who can sense its presence.\" He gestured to the ancient scrolls spread before him. “These texts indicate that the Lumiflora blooms only where magic is strongest, and where a specific bloodline resonates with its essence.”\n\n“And you believe I am that bloodline?” Trixie challenged.\n\nHamilton gave a curt nod. \"The evidence suggests it. I offer you a choice: cooperate, and perhaps your life will be spared. Resist, and…” He let the threat hang in the air, heavy and unspoken.\n\nTrixie knew she couldn't reason with him. She also knew that allowing Hamilton to find the Lumiflora would have catastrophic consequences – amplifying its power in his hands could destabilize all of Silverwood, perhaps even the entire Age of Magic.  She decided to play along, but on her own terms. \n\n“I will help you,” she said, carefully masking her true intentions. “But I cannot simply lead you there. The Whisperwind Glade is protected by ancient wards and illusions. It requires a specific ritual, one that only I know.”\n\nHamilton’s expression remained impassive. \"Very well. Let us begin.\"\n\nTheir journey into the Forbidden Forest was fraught with peril. Hamilton, armed with enchanted weaponry and an uncanny knowledge of magical creatures, cleared their path through monstrous spiders and shadowy wraiths. Trixie, meanwhile, subtly manipulated the forest's energies, creating illusions to mislead him, diverting dangers, and weakening his defenses – all while feigning cooperation.\n\nShe spun a tale of complex rituals and forgotten incantations, deliberately prolonging the journey and leading them deeper into the heart of the Glade. Elara, who had secretly followed them, provided subtle assistance from the shadows, healing Trixie’s wounds and disrupting Hamilton's tracking spells. \n\nAs they neared the Whisperwind Glade, the air grew thick with potent magic. The trees glowed with an ethereal light, their leaves shimmering with iridescent colors.  Trixie could feel the Lumiflora’s presence – a gentle pulse of pure, raw energy that resonated deep within her soul.\n\n“The ritual chamber is just ahead,” she announced, leading Hamilton through a tangle of vines and thorny bushes. “It requires a sacrifice – a conduit to channel the Glade's power.” \n\nHamilton smirked. \"An excellent opportunity to test your abilities, witch.\" He produced a shimmering crystal orb from his satchel - a powerful artifact designed to absorb magical energy.  “This will serve as our conduit.”\n\nTrixie knew this was her moment. “The sacrifice must be willing,” she corrected him. “The Glade rejects forced offerings. The magic will simply rebound, consuming the user.\" It wasn't entirely untrue; the Lumiflora’s power *was* volatile and unpredictable if not approached with respect. \n\nHamilton scoffed. \"You attempt to deceive me.” He moved to activate the orb, but Trixie acted swiftly. With a surge of Feywild magic, she bound his hands with thorny vines, momentarily immobilizing him.\n\n“The Lumiflora chooses its guardian,” she declared, her voice ringing with newfound power. “And it has chosen *me*.\" \n\nShe channeled her own energy into the Glade's heart, ignoring Hamilton’s struggling form and Elara's worried gaze. The forest responded to her call, a wave of emerald light washing over the clearing.  Then, in the center of the glade, amidst a circle of ancient stones, it bloomed – the Lumiflora. \n\nIt wasn't merely a flower; it was an explosion of vibrant colors and intoxicating fragrance, radiating pure magical energy. Petals unfurled like celestial wings, revealing a luminous core that pulsed with life. The air crackled with power as Trixie felt her own magic amplified tenfold – a surge so potent it threatened to overwhelm her senses.\n\nHamilton broke free from the vines, his eyes blazing with rage and frustration. \"You cannot control such power!\" he roared, raising his enchanted sword. \n\nBut Trixie was no longer the hesitant teenager who had first encountered him in Silverwood. She was a conduit for the Glade’s magic, its protector, its guardian.  She raised her hands, summoning tendrils of living vines that snaked around Hamilton's weapon, disarming him with ease. \n\n\"This power is not meant to be controlled,\" she said, her voice echoing with the ancient wisdom of the forest. \"It is meant to be nurtured, protected.” She unleashed a wave of pure magical energy, not to harm Hamilton, but to sever his connection to this place – to banish him from the Whisperwind Glade and back to the world he knew.\n\nWith a final, furious glare, Hamilton vanished in a swirl of shadows, leaving behind only the lingering scent of brimstone. \n\nTrixie turned her attention back to the Lumiflora, gently stroking its luminous petals. She felt a profound connection to it – a sense of shared purpose and responsibility. The Age of Magic was safe, for now. But she knew that her journey had just begun.  She was no longer simply Trixie Stevens, weaver of magic. She was the Guardian of the Lumiflora, the Chosen One destined to protect its power and safeguard the balance between worlds.\n\nElara approached cautiously, a relieved smile on her face. \"You did it,\" she said softly. “You saved Silverwood.”\n\nTrixie smiled back, but there was a trace of sadness in her eyes.  \"I didn't save Silverwood alone,\" she replied. “We all have a part to play in protecting what we cherish.\" She looked out at the shimmering canopy above them, feeling the weight of her newfound destiny settle upon her shoulders. \"And I suspect,” she added quietly, “that this is just the beginning.”"],"color":"#232","bgcolor":"#353"},{"id":2758,"type":"AIScriptCrafter03ScreenplayBible-Akki","pos":[2980,-390],"size":[336.4234313964844,354],"flags":{},"order":270,"mode":4,"inputs":[{"localized_name":"llm_model","name":"llm_model","type":"LLM_MODEL","link":null},{"localized_name":"story_text","name":"story_text","type":"STRING","link":50525},{"localized_name":"world_bible","name":"world_bible","type":"STRING","link":50526},{"localized_name":"character_bible","name":"character_bible","type":"STRING","link":50527},{"localized_name":"beat_sheet","name":"beat_sheet","type":"STRING","link":50528},{"localized_name":"prompt_stage_1","name":"prompt_stage_1","type":"COMBO","widget":{"name":"prompt_stage_1"},"link":null},{"localized_name":"prompt_stage_2","name":"prompt_stage_2","type":"COMBO","widget":{"name":"prompt_stage_2"},"link":null},{"localized_name":"prompt_stage_3","name":"prompt_stage_3","type":"COMBO","widget":{"name":"prompt_stage_3"},"link":null},{"localized_name":"cinematic_style","name":"cinematic_style","type":"STRING","widget":{"name":"cinematic_style"},"link":null},{"localized_name":"max_tokens","name":"max_tokens","type":"INT","widget":{"name":"max_tokens"},"link":null},{"localized_name":"temperature","name":"temperature","type":"FLOAT","widget":{"name":"temperature"},"link":null},{"localized_name":"top_p","name":"top_p","type":"FLOAT","widget":{"name":"top_p"},"link":null},{"localized_name":"top_k","name":"top_k","type":"INT","widget":{"name":"top_k"},"link":null},{"localized_name":"seed","name":"seed","type":"INT","widget":{"name":"seed"},"link":50529}],"outputs":[{"localized_name":"screenplay","name":"screenplay","type":"STRING","links":[50558]},{"localized_name":"scene_breakdown","name":"scene_breakdown","type":"STRING","links":null},{"localized_name":"full_llm_process_log","name":"full_llm_process_log","type":"STRING","links":null}],"properties":{"Node name for S&R":"AIScriptCrafter03ScreenplayBible-Akki","ue_properties":{"version":"7.0.1","widget_ue_connectable":{"prompt_stage_1":true,"prompt_stage_2":true,"prompt_stage_3":true,"cinematic_style":true,"max_tokens":true,"temperature":true,"top_p":true,"top_k":true,"seed":true}}},"widgets_values":["Stage 1 v5.txt","Stage 2 v2.txt","Stage 3 v2.txt","Gritty and realistic with handheld camera work",8192,0.7,0.95,40,1234,"fixed"],"color":"#5a6195","bgcolor":"#464d81"},{"id":2763,"type":"ShowText|pysssss","pos":[2800,10],"size":[660,680],"flags":{},"order":275,"mode":4,"inputs":[{"localized_name":"text","name":"text","type":"STRING","link":50558}],"outputs":[{"localized_name":"STRING","name":"STRING","shape":6,"type":"STRING","links":[50559]}],"title":"Screenplay","properties":{"cnr_id":"comfyui-custom-scripts","ver":"1.2.5","Node name for S&R":"ShowText|pysssss","ue_properties":{"version":"7.0.1","widget_ue_connectable":{}}},"widgets_values":["FADE IN:\n\n1.
