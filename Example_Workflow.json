Its towering skyscrapers pierced the rain-drenched sky, their peaks shrouded in mist. Neon advertisements flickered and pulsed, casting a gaudy glow across the rain-soaked streets.\n\nSam, a weary time traveler, navigated the crowded sidewalks with a determined stride. His eyes, sunken and bloodshot, darted between the faces of the passersby, searching for a glimpse of familiar blue fur. He had been chasing Chester the Beagle for what felt like an eternity.\n\nBehind him, the distant hum of a hovercar rose above the din of the city. Sam's heart quickened as he caught sight of a sleek, silver vehicle swooping down from the sky. Dean, the ruthless leader of the Red Hand gang, emerged from the vehicle with a cold, calculating smile.\n\nSam quickened his pace, dodging through the crowded sidewalks with Dean hot on his heels. He darted into a small alleyway, hoping to lose his pursuer. The alleyway, however, proved a dead end.\n\nWith a snarl, Dean closed in on Sam, his hand reaching for a concealed blade. Sam, anticipating the move, deftly dodged to the side, sending Dean stumbling into the alleyway wall.\n\nAs Dean recovered, Sam spotted a small, makeshift doorway in the alleyway's far corner. Without hesitation, he sprinted towards it, Dean's angry shout echoing off the walls behind him.\n\nThe doorway led to a cramped, dimly lit corridor. Sam's footsteps echoed off the walls as he made his way down the passage, the sounds of Dean's pursuit growing fainter with each step.\n\nFinally, he emerged into a large, open space filled with rows of sleek, silver hovercars. At the far end of the room, a lone figure stood waiting. Chester the Beagle, his blue fur shining in the dim light, looked up as Sam approached.\n\n\"Chester!\" Sam exclaimed, relief washing over him as he dropped to his knees beside the beagle.\n\nChester, tail wagging, nuzzled Sam's hand, as if sensing his relief. Together, they turned to face the approaching figure. It was an old man, his face lined with age and wear.\n\n\"Sam, you've made it,\" the old man said, his voice gruff. \"You've brought Chester. Now, we can get to work.\"\n\nSam, still crouched beside the beagle, looked up at the old man with a mixture of confusion and determination. \"Get to work? What's going on? Why have I brought Chester here?\"\n\nThe old man's eyes, red-rimmed and weary, locked onto Sam's. \"New Eden is doomed, Sam. Dean's plan is to detonate a nuclear device in the heart of the city, plunging the metropolis into chaos. It's up to you, Chester, and me to stop him.\"\n\nSam's eyes widened, his heart racing. \"A nuclear device? But how do we—\"\n\nThe old man cut him off, a wry smile twisting his lips. \"We have a small window of time before detonation. Chester and I have a plan, but it's going to require you to trust us.\"\n\nSam's gaze flicked between the old man and the beagle, his mind racing. He thought of Dean, his pursuer, and the desperate, racing heart. He thought of Chester, his loyal companion, and the old man's pleading eyes.\n\nWith a nod, Sam steeled himself. \"Okay. Let's do it. We have to stop Dean and save the city.\"\n\nChester, as if sensing Sam's determination, let out a loud bark, his tail wagging furiously. The old man smiled, relief etched across his face.\n\n\"Good boy, Chester,\" he said, his voice barely above a whisper. \"Together, we have a chance to save New Eden. Let's do this.\"\n\nAs the three of them set off into the unknown, the sound of Dean's angry shout echoed through the corridors, a reminder that time was running out. The fate of New Eden hung in the balance, and only Sam, Chester, and the old man stood between it and destruction.\n\nThe city lights twinkled and shone above them, a distant reminder of the world they were fighting to save. Together, they plunged into the heart of the city, racing against time to prevent the unthinkable. The outcome was far from certain, but one thing was clear: New Eden would never be the same. The fate of the city, and those within it, hung precariously in the balance, as the three unlikely heroes embarked on their perilous journey."],"color":"#323","bgcolor":"#535"},{"id":60,"type":"LLMLoader-Akki","pos":[1150,-370],"size":[270,278],"flags":{},"order":0,"mode":0,"inputs":[{"localized_name":"gguf_name","name":"gguf_name","type":"COMBO","widget":{"name":"gguf_name"},"link":null},{"localized_name":"n_gpu_layers","name":"n_gpu_layers","type":"INT","widget":{"name":"n_gpu_layers"},"link":null},{"localized_name":"main_gpu","name":"main_gpu","type":"INT","widget":{"name":"main_gpu"},"link":null},{"localized_name":"n_ctx","name":"n_ctx","type":"INT","widget":{"name":"n_ctx"},"link":null},{"localized_name":"n_batch","name":"n_batch","type":"INT","widget":{"name":"n_batch"},"link":null},{"localized_name":"verbose","name":"verbose","type":"BOOLEAN","widget":{"name":"verbose"},"link":null}],"outputs":[{"localized_name":"llm_model","name":"llm_model","type":"LLM_MODEL","links":[326]},{"localized_name":"model_name","name":"model_name","type":"STRING","links":null},{"localized_name":"architecture","name":"architecture","type":"STRING","links":null},{"localized_name":"quantization","name":"quantization","type":"STRING","links":null},{"localized_name":"model_ctx_size","name":"model_ctx_size","type":"STRING","links":null},{"localized_name":"offloaded_layers","name":"offloaded_layers","type":"STRING","links":null}],"properties":{"Node

I'll find you and Chester, and this city will burn.\n\nSam quickens his pace, dodging through the crowded sidewalks as Dean closes in. Sam spots a small alleyway and darts into it, hoping to lose Dean.\n\nThe alleyway proves a dead end. Dean appears, his hand reaching for a concealed blade.\n\nSAM\n(nimbly dodging)\nNo, Dean! You'll never catch me!\n\nDean snarls, closing in on Sam. Sam spots a small doorway in the alleyway's far corner and sprints towards it.\n\nDean's angry shout echoes off the walls as Sam disappears into the doorway. The doorway leads to a cramped, dimly lit corridor.\n\nSam's footsteps echo off the walls as he makes his way down the passage, Dean's pursuit growing fainter with each step. Finally, he emerges into a large, open space filled with rows of sleek, silver hovercars.\n\nAt the far end of the room, a lone figure stands waiting. Chester the Beagle, his blue fur shining in the dim light, looks up as Sam approaches.\n\nCHESTER\n(wagging his tail)\nSam! I'm here! Let's get out of here!\n\nSam drops to his knees beside Chester, relief washing over him.\n\nSAM\nWe have to get to the old man. He's the only one who can help us stop Dean.\n\nThe two of them set off towards the far end of the room. Chester, sensing Sam's determination, lets out a loud bark.\n\nSuddenly, an old man appears from the shadows, his face lined with age and wear.\n\nOLD MAN\nSam, you've made it. You've brought Chester. Now, we can get to work.\n\nSAM\n(confused)\nGet to work? What's going on? Why have I brought Chester here?\n\nThe old man's eyes, red-rimmed and weary, lock onto Sam's.\n\nOLD MAN\nNew Eden is doomed, Sam. Dean's plan is to detonate a nuclear device in the heart of the city, plunging the metropolis into chaos. It's up to you, Chester, and me to stop him.\n\nSam's eyes widen, his heart racing.\n\nSAM\n(nodding)\nA nuclear device? But how do we—\n\nOLD MAN\n(interrupting)\nWe have a small window of time before detonation. Chester and I have a plan, but it's going to require you to trust us.\n\nSam nods, steeeling himself.\n\nSAM\nAlright. Let's do it. We have to stop Dean and save the city.\n\nChester lets out another loud bark, his tail wagging furiously. The old man smiles, relief etched across his face.\n\nOLD MAN\nGood boy, Chester. Together, we have a chance to save New Eden. Let's do this.\n\nAs the three of them set off into the unknown, the sound of Dean's angry shout echoes through the corridors, a reminder that time is running out. The fate of New Eden hangs in the balance, and only Sam, Chester, and the old man stand between it and destruction.\n\nThe city lights twinkle and shine above them, a distant reminder of the world they are fighting to save. Together, they plunge into the heart of the city, racing against time to prevent the unthinkable. The outcome is far from certain, but one thing is clear: New Eden will never be the same. The fate of the city, and those within it, hangs precariously in the balance, as the three unlikely heroes embark on their perilous journey.\n\nFADE OUT."],"color":"#232","bgcolor":"#353"}],"links":[[195,36,0,40,1,"STRING"],[196,36,11,40,2,"STRING"],[197,36,12,40,3,"STRING"],[198,36,3,40,4,"STRING"],[199,36,4,40,5,"STRING"],[200,36,8,40,6,"STRING"],[201,36,9,40,7,"STRING"],[202,40,0,24,0,"STRING"],[203,40,1,26,0,"STRING"],[204,40,2,27,0,"STRING"],[205,40,3,28,0,"STRING"],[206,40,4,29,0,"STRING"],[216,36,0,42,0,"*"],[217,42,0,12,0,"STRING"],[218,42,0,41,1,"STRING"],[219,40,2,41,2,"STRING"],[220,41,0,43,0,"STRING"],[291,42,0,54,1,"STRING"],[292,40,2,54,2,"STRING"],[293,41,0,54,3,"STRING"],[294,54,0,45,0,"STRING"],[326,60,0,22,0,"LLM_MODEL"]],"groups":[{"id":1,"title":"LLM Loader","bounding":[1140,-500,292.1890869140625,455.6000061035156],"color":"#A88","font_size":24,"flags":{}},{"id":2,"title":"AI Story Writer","bounding":[1450,-500,420,1213.5999755859375],"color":"#a1309b","font_size":24,"flags":{}},{"id":3,"title":"AI ScriptCrafter 01 (Foundation)","bounding":[1890,-500,420,1163.5999755859375],"color":"#b58b2a","font_size":24,"flags":{}},{"id":4,"title":"AI ScriptCrafter 02 (Beat Sheet)","bounding":[2330,-500,450,863.5999755859375],"color":"#8AA","font_size":24,"flags":{}},{"id":5,"title":"AI ScriptCrafter 02 (Beat Sheet)","bounding":[2800,-500,470,953.5999755859375],"color":"#8A8","font_size":24,"flags":{}}],"config":{},"extra":{"ds":{"scale":1,"offset":[-772.035357109502,580.7990484990073]},"0246.VERSION":[0,0,4],"ue_links":[{"downstream":40,"downstream_slot":0,"upstream":"60","upstream_slot":0,"controller":22,"type":"LLM_MODEL"},{"downstream":41,"downstream_slot":0,"upstream":"60","upstream_slot":0,"controller":22,"type":"LLM_MODEL"},{"downstream":54,"downstream_slot":0,"upstream":"60","upstream_slot":0,"controller":22,"type":"LLM_MODEL"},{"downstream":36,"downstream_slot":0,"upstream":"60","upstream_slot":0,"controller":22,"type":"LLM_MODEL"}],"links_added_by_ue":[339,340,341,342],"workspace_info":{"id":"s2bnYe2mazqe7uNnF0i6u","saveLock":false,"cloudID":null,"coverMediaPath":null}},"version":0.4}
